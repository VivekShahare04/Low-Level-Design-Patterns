# Low-Level Design & Design Patterns Practice

## Overview
This repository is a **learning and practice space** where I am systematically studying **Low-Level Design (LLD)** concepts and **design patterns**, and implementing them through **clean, minimal, hands-on code examples**.

The goal is **understanding by building**, not production-ready frameworks.

---

## What This Repo Contains
- 📐 **Low-Level Design concepts**
- 🧩 **Design Patterns (creational, structural, behavioral)**
- 💻 **Code implementations** for practice
- 🔍 **Examples focused on clarity**, not over-engineering

Each pattern or concept will have:
- A short explanation
- A practical use case
- One or more code implementations

---

## Why This Repository Exists
- To build **strong LLD fundamentals**
- To practice **thinking in abstractions**
- To improve **interview readiness**
- To create a **reference repo** for future revision

This is **not a tutorial repo**, but a **learning-in-public** repo.

---

## Tech Stack
- Language: `Java` *(primary)*
- Additional languages may be added later if useful

---

## Structure (Evolving)

> Structure may change as learning progresses.

---

## How to Use This Repo
- Browse pattern folders
- Read the explanation
- Run the code
- Modify and experiment

If you're also learning LLD, feel free to **fork and practice along**.

---

## Disclaimer
- Code is written for **learning purposes**
- Not optimized for production
- Improvements will be made over time as understanding deepens

---

## Contributions
This is primarily a **personal learning repo**, but:
- Suggestions
- Corrections
- Better implementations  

are always welcome via PRs or issues.

---

## Status
🚧 **Work in Progress**  
Content will be added gradually as concepts are studied and implemented.
